   <p><img src="./img/truck.jpg" width="250px">In Afghanistan, truck art has origins  <br>dating back to the 1920s, when Bedford trucks imported from England <br>invaded the country's streets. They were fitted with large wooden prows on top of the truck bed. <br>Known as a taj, or crown, the ornate prow was also <br>accompanied by decorative bumpers and wood paneling along the cabin.</p> 
    <p><img src="./img/brt.jpg" width="250 px"> Launched with the financial support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) <br> and Agence Française De Développement (AFD) with an estimated cost of Pakistani Rupee <br> (PK Rs.)71 billion (US dollar 331.83 million), the new state of the art transport facility is now being used by a record number of 260,000 passengers <br> on a daily basis including 70,000 women utilising 25 per cent seating quota reserved for them in each bus, <br> according to TransPeshawar, a government owned company that manages operation of BRT. <br> The company says that around 4.5 million female passengers have already used the new bus service <br> introduced with the brand name of `Zu’, <br> a word of locally spoken Pashto language with meaning `go’. <br> The number of women travelling in public transport has increased from earlier 2 per cent to 20 per cent <br>after the introduction of Peshawar Zu service, which reflects <br> confidence and satisfaction of womenfolk in the new transport service, <br>claims TransPeshawar.

     <p><img src="img/sunehri.jpg" width="250px">Unlike the Wazir Khan Mosque and Badshahi Mosque <br>which were built at the zenith of the Mughal Empire in the 17th century, <br> the Sunehri Mosque was built in 1753 when the empire was in decline. <br> The architect of the mosque was Nawab Bukhari Khan, deputy governor of Lahore <br> during the reign of Muhammad Shah.</p>
