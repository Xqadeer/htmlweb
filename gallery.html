  <p> <img src="./img/tirah.jpg" width="250px">Despite poor infrastructure, lack of health and education facilities, <br>thousands of visitors toured to the remote Tirah valley during <br>recent Eidul Azha holidays to enjoy pleasant weather, <br>tribal hospitality, traditional foods and sights and sounds of the region <br> once infested with militants.</p>
 <p> <img src="./img/kalam.jpg" width="250px">The Naran-Kaghan Valley of KPK <br>is renowned for its history dated back to British Colonial period. <br> Since the stone age to the current era, <br> the region had inhabited several casts like Swati, <br> Awan, Kashmiri, Durai, Mughal, and Quarish. <br> The region is rich in terms of historical <br>buildings and monuments. </p>
  <p><img src="./img/babosar.jpg" width="250px">Naran is a town and popular tourist destination in upper  <br>Kaghan Valley in the Mansehra District of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa <br>province of Pakistan. <br> It is located 119 kilometers from Mansehra city at the altitude of 2,409 </p>
 <p> <img src="./img/badabera.jpg" width="250px"> The Badaber fortress, 24 km south of Peshawar, <br> was a military training centre of the <br> Afghan Mujahideen who opposed Soviet presence in Afghanistan. <br> The Mujahideen were trained by military instructors from the United States (Operation Cyclone) and Pakistan.  </p>
 <p><img src="./img/minarejumat.jpg" width="250px"> Last weekend I visited Bara <br> Tehsil of Khyber Agency <br>for the second time. My first visit was in 2008, <br> when this was the hub of businesses but <br> now their were only wrecks.

  Last time when we were crossing Bara Market took <br> almost an hour but this time there were no traffic <br>and was just like wilderness.
  
  Those Markets having 2000 shops of <br>different imported and local products were destroyed. </p>
